# React Practice: **_Refactored Matching Number Game_**

## Demo: :bike:

## Purpose: :dart:

This is a refactored version of the previous Matching Number game.

I heard about one CSS-in-JS called Emotion, so I decided to try it out, a little stumble during the setup but got it work in the end.

One thing important was that I splitted the code into modules and import them for using in the necessary file. Separating each module's responsbility and make the program more modular.
